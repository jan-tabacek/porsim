## 1. Introduction

This document shows a basic example of how to originate a vintage of loans
using the `portfolioSim` package.

## 2. Define Parameters

First, we define the parameters for our product and client segment.

```{r}
# Define the parameters you provided
product_mtp <- list(
  product_name = "MTP",
  min_amount = 1,
  max_amount = 1000,
  contract_duration = 5, # number of time periods. eventually can be days, but for now period = month
  periods_till_debt_sell = 3, # periods to wait in default before selling
  debt_sell_price = 0.6 # percentage from balance for which i can sell defaulted loan
  # ... etc ...
)

segment_standard <- list(
  avg_limit_pct_of_max = 0.80,
  avg_first_balance_pct_of_limit = 0.95
)
```


```{r}
# Generate 100 new loans for January 2025
january_vintage <- originate_loans(
  vintage_date = as.Date("2025-01-31"),
  n_loans = 3,
  # ... etc ...
)

# View the result
print(january_vintage)

```
